# Discord-Badminton-Club-Scheduling-Bot

Project Description:

Designed and developed a robust Discord bot to manage and organize scheduling within a server. The bot was built with Python, using the discord.py library, demonstrating advanced knowledge in asynchronous programming and command handling. The bot's primary functions include registering, cancelling, displaying, and resetting user schedules.

Key features of the project include:

-> User Registration: The bot allows users to register themselves for a specific time slot (ranging from 6 am to 6 pm) using the '#join' command followed by the desired time. The bot also provides feedback to the user confirming their registration.

-> User Cancellation: Users can remove themselves from the schedule using the '#canceljoin' command. The bot identifies and removes the user from the schedule, followed by a confirmation message.

-> Schedule Display: Implemented the '#schedule' command that displays a comprehensive schedule, displaying each time slot along with the users registered for it. This uses Discord embeds to deliver an organized and visually appealing presentation.

-> Schedule Reset: Built-in functionality for clearing the schedule with the '#clearschedule' command. This resets all time slots, preparing for a new day.

-> Help Command: Implemented a comprehensive help command, '#help', which outlines the bot's functionalities and usage to aid new users.

This project showcases the ability to implement effective bot commands, manage a server-side application, and interact with an API, providing real-time user engagement and interaction. Demonstrating coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and user-centric design.
